# Slots Games' Success Predictor
This project was built to satisfy the need of a real-life company which is dedicated to developing games for online casinos. This was also my thesis project for my master's in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning of the University of Alcala de Henares (Spain).

* Feed Forward Neural Network
* Sequential Model

## Problem Description
The company needed a model that helped them predict if a Slots Game was going to be a market success or a market failure, by analyzing the way the game rewarded the players.
In other words, a model that could tell if the way that a game rewards a player , will influence him/her to continue playing.

 based on the rewards that the game gave to the player. 

Considering that we are dealing with an entertainment product, we need to understand that the success of a game will be determined by the level of preference of the consumers, in this case, the players, and how much time do they spend playing them.

This was also my thesis project for my master's in Machine Learning and Deep Learning from the University of Alcala de Henares.

The amt of the payout, the length of a losing streaks, or winning streaks.

## Solution Approach
This problem was tackled from 2 different approaches.

Trying to find if there is a pattern in the payout sequence of the games that influences the player to continue plyaing, using a sequential model.

Feeding the summarized distribution of the game's rewards into a Feed Forward neural network.
