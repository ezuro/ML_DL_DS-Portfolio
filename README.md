# ML/DL/DS Portfolio
The present site is a personal portfolio of different Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science projects.

Currently, the site contains the thesis project I did for my master's degree in Artificial Intelligence & Deep Learning, from the university of Alcala de Henares (Spain). The project tackled a real life problem of a real life company.
