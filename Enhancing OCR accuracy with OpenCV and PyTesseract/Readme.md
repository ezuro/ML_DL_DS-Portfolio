# Enhancing OCR accuracy with OpenCV and PyTesseract
## Abstract
In this article we will see how can we enhace OCR (Optical Character Recognition) accuracy, by using different OpenCV image pre-processing techniques, such as

We will see different practical examples using PyTesseract, however other OCR tools could also be employed.
