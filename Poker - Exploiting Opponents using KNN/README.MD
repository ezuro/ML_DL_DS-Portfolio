# NLH Poker - Exploiting Opponents using KNN
When playing poker (No-Limit Hold'em), we will encounter different types of players. Some of them more aggressive, other more defensive, some will play a lot of hands and others just a few. For each of those types of players we will need to adjust our strategy to maximize our profits or minimize our losses.

We can recollect data of each player we have ever played against (such as their VPIP, PFR, CBET%, etc.) and create categories of players using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) based on this data to identify how these categories of players can be exploited and how should we play against each of them in different scenarios.
