# NLH Poker - Exploiting Opponents using KNN
When playing poker (No-Limit Hold'em), we will encounter different types of players. Some of them more aggressive, other more defensive, some will play a lot of hands and others just a few. For each of those types of players we will need to adjust our strategy to maximize our profits or minimize our losses.

In this project I will recollect different data of each player I have ever played against (such as VPIP, PFR, CBET%, etc.) and create categories of players using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) from this information, so then I can identify how these different categories of players can be exploited and how should I play against them in different scenarios.
